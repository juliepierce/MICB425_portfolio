###What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?

Tectonic movement along with photochemical reactions in the atmosphere allow for mixing and partitioning of chemical substrates on Earth. 

Geophysical (abiotic): Tectonics (Acid/base), transfer of protons without electrons, atmospheric photochemical processes (photochemistry/radical chemistry = ‘magic’)
Biogeochemical: 
 (Redox)

###Why is Earth’s redox state considered an emergent property?
 
The earth’s redox state is considered an emergent property because it depends on both geochemical processes and microbial metabolic processes. 
 
###How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?
 
 Reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles because of the thermodynamic conditions that make each reaction favorable. Specifically, the rate at which each reaction occurs is determined by the conditions of the environment (i.e. abundance of substrates, products, et. cetera) thus allowing for nutrients to cycle in a stable manner. 

###Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox “niches” and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?

The different stages of the nitrogen cycle all require different amounts of oxygen, corresponding to different redox niches, and the other microbes that will be in that environment. In nitrogen fixation, nitrogen gas is fixed from our atmosphere into ammonium. This is done by nitrogenase, which is inhibited by oxygen, yet this is still done in many microbes in aerobic environments. Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and finally nitrate, happens in aerobic environments. Denitrification, the anaerobic oxidation of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen gas, occurs in anoxic/anaerobic environments.
Indirectly, the nitrogen cycle is connected to climate change. All microbes require nitrogen to synthesize protein and nucleic acids, and the only method of nitrogen fixation is via microorganisms. The nitrogen cycle is what controls the amount of available fixed nitrogen, which in turn affects the number of microbes carrying out various other reactions, which in turn produces the Earth’s atmosphere. Additionally, if something were to shift in the nitrogen cycle and affect those microbes involved, it would in turn affect the overall microbial community. The nitrogen cycle does not directly affect climate change, as only nitrogen and hydrogen gas are emitted during nitrogen fixation, nitrification, or denitrification, neither of which are greenhouse gases.
 

###What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?
 
Although there is enormous genetic diversity in nature, there remains a relatively stable
set of core genes coding for the major redox reactions essential for life and biogeochemical cycles. Thus, microbial diversity does not necessarily entail diversity in proteins involved in metabolism. 

It is hypothesized that there is limitless evolutionary diversity in nature. The rate of discovery of unique protein families has been proportional to the sampling effort, with the number of new protein families increasing approximately linearly with the number of new genomes sequenced.


###On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?

Temporary and simultaneous guardianship because of the nature of microbial evolution from horizontal and vertical gene transfer, which can change which phenotype is dominant at the time. A dominant phenotype protects the metabolic pathway in the environment, and if it does not survive environmental perturbations applying selective pressures on pathway genes, then it will disappear. Humans could possibly replicate the individual pathways, but the overall metabolic biogeochemical processes that control the flow of electrons can only be done by microbes.
